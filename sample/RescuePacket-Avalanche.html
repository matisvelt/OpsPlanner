  <div class="section"><h2>Scenario</h2><pre>Avalanche Aftermath: Missing Hiker Recovery (Training Case)</pre></div>

  <div class="section"><h2>1) Incident Input</h2><pre>Incident Summary (Training):
Title: Avalanche Aftermath: Missing Hiker Recovery (Training Case)
Context: A solo hiker is overdue after an avalanche event in a mountainous region. Last known area is an approximate polygon spanning Sectors A/B/C based on cell ping and witness report. Weather is deteriorating (wind, snowfall) and daylight is limited.
Last Known Area: Polygon across Sectors A/B/C with uncertainty gradient toward Sector C
Time Last Seen: ~4 hours ago (training estimate)
Daylight Window: Approx. 3 hours of usable light remaining (training estimate)
Weather: Wind increasing, snowfall forecast; visibility trending downward.
Comms: Patchy coverage; reliable only in lower elevations and ridgeline gaps.
Medical Risk: Hypothermia risk increases with time; survivability window uncertain.
Note: This draft is for planning and governance only; it does not include procedural rescue actions.</pre></div>

  <div class="section"><h2>2) Constraints & Authorities</h2><pre>Legal Authority: Search authorized under regional SAR protocol with park service oversight.
Safety Policy: No entry into high-hazard zones without explicit Safety Officer gate approval.
Time Windows: Primary search window: daylight remaining; night ops require separate approval.
Weather/Aviation Restrictions: Aviation restricted above wind index threshold; whiteout risk.
Medical Constraints: Rapid transfer to medical care required if located; triage protocols apply.</pre></div>

  <div class="section"><h2>3) Information Requirements</h2><pre>- Last known location confidence | Indicator: Updated cell ping or witness validation | Priority: High | Status: Open
- Victim survivability time window | Indicator: Medical lead estimate vs exposure | Priority: High | Status: Open
- Avalanche hazard index by sector | Indicator: Avalanche bulletin + local observation | Priority: High | Status: Open
- Access time to each sector | Indicator: Route status + mobility estimate | Priority: Medium | Status: Open
- Comms reliability by sector | Indicator: Radio checks + relay test | Priority: Medium | Status: Open
- Helicopter constraints and go/no-go factors | Indicator: Aviation liaison update | Priority: Medium | Status: Open
- Medical evacuation constraints | Indicator: Medical lead + transport availability | Priority: Medium | Status: Open
Derived Needs: Clarify sector probability weights and confirm road access status before committing resources.</pre></div>

  <div class="section"><h2>4) Environment/System Model</h2><pre>- Sector A | Size: Ridge bowl | Access: 3 | Hazard: 4 | Visibility: 2 | Comms: 0.60 | Time: 1.5-3.0 hrs | Weight: 0.35
- Sector B | Size: Tree line traverse | Access: 4 | Hazard: 3 | Visibility: 2 | Comms: 0.50 | Time: 2.0-4.0 hrs | Weight: 0.25
- Sector C | Size: Upper basin | Access: 5 | Hazard: 5 | Visibility: 1 | Comms: 0.30 | Time: 3.0-6.0 hrs | Weight: 0.20
- Sector D | Size: Lower drainage | Access: 2 | Hazard: 2 | Visibility: 3 | Comms: 0.70 | Time: 1.0-2.5 hrs | Weight: 0.15
- Sector E | Size: Trailhead area | Access: 1 | Hazard: 1 | Visibility: 4 | Comms: 0.90 | Time: 0.5-1.0 hrs | Weight: 0.05
Dependencies:
- Sector C access depends on Road 2 open
- Air support availability depends on wind index below threshold
Uncertainty Map Notes: Uncertainty highest in Sector C due to limited visibility and comms gaps.</pre></div>

  <div class="section"><h2>5) Risk Register + Assumptions</h2><pre>- [R1] Secondary avalanche in Sector C | L:4 I:5 | Mitigation: Gate entry on hazard index and visibility updates | Owner: Safety Officer
- [R2] Comms relay failure in upper sectors | L:3 I:4 | Mitigation: Establish relay plan and periodic check-ins | Owner: Comms & Tracking
- [R3] Access route blocked by snowfall | L:3 I:4 | Mitigation: Alternate route planning and mobility staging | Owner: Mobility/Logistics
- [R4] Survivability window shorter than expected | L:3 I:5 | Mitigation: Prioritize high-probability sectors and medical readiness | Owner: Medical Lead
Assumptions:
- Helicopter availability remains uncertain (Confidence: LOW, Fragility: VOLATILE)
- Sector probability weights remain stable for 2 hours (Confidence: MEDIUM, Fragility: FRAGILE)
- Road 2 remains open (Confidence: LOW, Fragility: FRAGILE)</pre></div>

  <div class="section"><h2>6) COA Builder</h2><pre>COA Summary (Abstract, Non-Tactical):

Ground-first prioritized by probability distribution
Objective: Allocate ground teams to highest-probability sectors while preserving safety gates.
Phases:
- Phase 0: Confirm access, comms, and hazard updates (Timing: 0-30 min)
- Phase 1: Search Sector A then B based on probability weights (Timing: 30-120 min)
- Phase 2: Expand to Sector C/D if gates permit (Timing: 120-240 min)
- Phase 3: Consolidate findings and transition to handover (Timing: 240+ min)
Safety Gates: Avalanche risk gate, Comms blackout gate
Key Assumptions: Ground access remains viable for Sectors A/B
Risks: Time loss if access blocked
Info Needs: Updated probability weights by sector
Assessment Measures: Coverage of A/B within first 2 hours

Safety-first constrained search (minimize responder exposure)
Objective: Limit exposure by restricting search to low-hazard sectors unless gates are cleared.
Phases:
- Phase 0: Confirm gates and hazard updates (Timing: 0-30 min)
- Phase 1: Focus on low-hazard sectors D/E (Timing: 30-120 min)
- Phase 2: Conditional expansion to A/B with safety concurrence (Timing: 120-240 min)
- Phase 3: Reassess and transition to recovery/handover (Timing: 240+ min)
Safety Gates: Weather cutoff, Avalanche risk gate
Key Assumptions: Low-hazard sectors still allow meaningful coverage
Risks: Lower probability of contact if high-probability sectors deferred
Info Needs: Hazard updates every 30 minutes
Assessment Measures: Responder exposure kept below threshold</pre></div>

  <div class="section"><h2>7) Rehearsal / Branch-Sequel</h2><pre>Branch Cards:
